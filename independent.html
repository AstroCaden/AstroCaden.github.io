      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        This independent research project focuses on the use of numerical relativity codes <strong>RNS</strong> and <strong>LORENE</strong> 
        to model the structure of rapidly rotating neutron stars under varying physical parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Custom <strong>C++ programs</strong> were written to automate parameter sweeps across a range of central densities, rotation frequencies, 
        and stellar masses. These routines invoked RNS and LORENE solvers iteratively to compute the corresponding stellar equilibrium configurations, 
        including quantities such as gravitational mass, equatorial radius, moment of inertia, and central density.
      </p>
      <p>
        The output data from each model run were written to structured text files, which were subsequently parsed using a 
        <strong>Python analysis pipeline</strong>. This Python script organised the numerical results and generated 2D and 3D visualisations 
        to explore relationships between the principal parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The figures below show (1) six 2D projections illustrating parameter correlations, and (2) a 3D scatter visualisation of 
        mass, radius, and frequency, coloured by central density. These plots highlight expected relativistic trends: increasing rotation frequency 
        corresponds to greater equatorial radii and reduced central densities at constant mass, consistent with rotational flattening effects 
        predicted by the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff formalism and relativistic corrections handled by RNS and LORENE.
