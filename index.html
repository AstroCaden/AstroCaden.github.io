    <h2>IFJ PAN Internship – Kraków, Poland</h2>
    <p>
      During my 2024 research internship at the Institute of Nuclear Physics (IFJ PAN), I studied the internal 
      structure of hybrid neutron stars within the Einstein Telescope detection range. I implemented and refined 
      a Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff solver, converting it from C++ to Python to analyse over 100 candidate equations 
      of state, producing mass–radius relations and tidal deformability plots.

    <h2>Teide Observatory Project – Tenerife, Spain</h2>
    <p>
      At the IAC’s Teide Observatory I collaborated on a project analysing data and imagery from small-telescope 
      observations. The work focused on practical aspects of observation planning and presentation of results 
      to a general audience.
